description: Overview of the Armory protocol and architecture
title: Overview
---

Armory is a payment protocol for APIs, built on EIP-3009. Let your users pay with USDC directly from their wallet—no credit cards, no middlemen.

<Callout type="info">
**x402 Specification Compatibility**: Armory is fully compatible with the [Coinbase x402 specification](https://github.com/coinbase/x402). All protocol changes must be validated against the official spec to ensure cross-SDK compatibility. See the [x402 V2 spec](https://github.com/coinbase/x402/blob/main/specs/x402-specification-v2.md) for details.

## How it works

Your client signs a payment authorization (off-chain, no gas) and sends it with their API request. You verify the signature, respond with the data they paid for, and settle the payment on-chain. Simple as that.

## Packages

**Core**
- `@armory-sh/base` — Types, encoding, network config

**Server-side**
- `@armory-sh/middleware` — Drop-in middleware for Express, Hono, Bun, Elysia
- `@armory-sh/middleware-express` — Express v5 middleware
- `@armory-sh/middleware-express-v4` — Express v4 middleware
- `@armory-sh/middleware-hono` — Hono middleware
- `@armory-sh/middleware-bun` — Bun middleware
- `@armory-sh/middleware-elysia` — Elysia middleware
- `@armory-sh/middleware-next` — Next.js App Router middleware

**Client-side**
- `@armory-sh/client-viem` — Viem integration
- `@armory-sh/client-ethers` — Ethers.js v6 integration
- `@armory-sh/client-web3` — Web3.js integration

**Utilities**
- `@armory-sh/tokens` — Pre-configured token objects
- `@armory-sh/extensions` — Protocol extensions (SIWX, payment ID)
- `armory-cli` — CLI for scaffolding projects

## Get Started

- [Accept Payments](/accept-payments/express) — Add payments to your API
- [Make Payments](/make-payments/viem) — Pay for APIs from your app
- [Packages](/packages/base) — Full API reference

## Why EIP-3009?

EIP-3009's `transferWithAuthorization` lets payers create off-chain signatures that anyone can execute. That means:

- **Gasless for payers** — Your users don't pay gas
- **Secure** — Nonces and expiration prevent replay attacks
- **Standard** — Works with any EIP-3009 token out of the box

## Networks

Ethereum, Base, and SKALE — mainnets and testnets ready.

## Tokens

USDC everywhere. USDT, DAI, and WBTC on select chains.
