description: Introduction to Armory and how to get started with x402 v2 payments
title: Introduction
---

Armory is a TypeScript toolkit for x402 v2 payments that lets APIs require wallet-based payment over standard HTTP flows.

<Callout type="info">
Armory targets x402 v2 wire compatibility so Armory clients and middleware can interoperate with Coinbase x402 SDK implementations.
</Callout>

## What You Can Build

- Paid API endpoints using middleware in Express, Hono, Bun, Elysia, and Next.js.
- Wallet-based API clients using Viem, Ethers.js, and Web3.js.
- Multi-network and multi-token payment flows with shared base logic.

## How Armory Works

1. A protected endpoint returns `402` with `PAYMENT-REQUIRED`.
2. The client selects one option from `accepts[]` and signs a payment payload.
3. The retried request sends `PAYMENT-SIGNATURE`.
4. The server verifies/settles and returns data with `PAYMENT-RESPONSE`.

## Start Here

- [Key Concepts](/key-concepts)
- [Accept Payments](/accept-payments/express)
- [Make Payments](/make-payments/viem)
- [CLI](/cli)

## Core Packages

- `@armory-sh/base`: shared protocol types, encoding, and payment flow logic.
- Middleware packages: route protection and payment verification.
- Client packages: wallet integration and payment retries.
- `@armory-sh/extensions`: optional protocol extensions.
- `@armory-sh/client-hooks`: optional selection/logging hooks.

## Supported Networks and Tokens

Armory supports Ethereum, Base, SKALE, and testnets listed in the protocol docs, with major payment tokens including USDC.
