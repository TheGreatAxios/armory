title: Armory Hooks Overview
description: Understand Armory's client hook lifecycle and execution model
---

Armory hooks are lifecycle callbacks that run during payment execution.

Hooks are not x402 protocol fields. They are local runtime behavior for selection, mutation, logging, and error handling.

## Lifecycle

1. `onPaymentRequired`
2. `selectRequirement`
3. `beforeSignPayment`
4. `afterPaymentResponse`
5. `onError`

## Execution Model

- Hooks execute in array order
- Selection narrows progressively as hooks run
- Hook failures are fail-closed by default
