description: Payment middleware for Bun servers
title: "@armory-sh/middleware-bun"
---


Accept crypto payments in your Bun HTTP server with a single function call.

## Installation

```bash
# npm
npm install @armory-sh/middleware-bun

# yarn
yarn add @armory-sh/middleware-bun

# pnpm
pnpm add @armory-sh/middleware-bun

# bun
bun add @armory-sh/middleware-bun
```

## Quick Start

```typescript
import { createBunMiddleware } from '@armory-sh/middleware-bun';

const middleware = createBunMiddleware({
  payTo: '0xYourWalletAddress...',
  amount: '1.0'
});

Bun.serve({
  port: 3000,
  fetch: async (req) => {
    const result = await middleware(req);

    // If middleware returns a response, payment failed/required
    if (result) return result;

    // Payment verified — handle your request
    return new Response(JSON.stringify({ data: 'protected content' }));
  }
});
```

## How It Works

The middleware intercepts incoming requests and:

1. Checks for payment headers (`X-Payment` or `X402-PAYMENT`)
2. Verifies the payment signature and amount
3. Returns `null` if valid (allowing your handler to proceed)
4. Returns a `Response` with 402 status if payment is missing or invalid

## Configuration

### Required Options

```typescript
{
  payTo: string,     // Your wallet address
  amount: string | bigint  // Amount to charge
}
```

### Settlement Modes

Control how payments are settled after verification:

```typescript
const middleware = createBunMiddleware({
  payTo: '0x...',
  amount: '1.0',
  settlementMode: 'verify'  // | 'settle' | 'async'
});
```

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `verify` | Verify only, don't settle (good for testing) |
| `settle` | Verify and settle on-chain before responding |
| `async` | Return immediately, settle in background |

### Verification Backend

Use your deployed verification backend in production.

---

## Response Format

On successful payment verification, the middleware returns a `Response` with:

**Headers:**
- `X-Payment-Verified: true`
- `X-Payer-Address: 0x...`

**Body:**
```json
{
  "verified": true,
  "payerAddress": "0x...",
  "version": 2
}
```

## Error Responses

### 402 Payment Required

No payment header was provided.

```json
{
  "error": "Payment required"
}
```

### 402 Verification Failed

Payment signature or amount was invalid.

```json
{
  "error": "Payment verification failed: ..."
}
```

### 400 Settlement Failed

Settlement mode was `settle` but on-chain transaction failed.

```json
{
  "error": "Settlement failed"
}
```

## Tips

<Tip>
For development and testing, use `settlementMode: 'verify'` to skip on-chain settlement while still verifying payment signatures.
</Tip>

<Note>
The `amount` can be specified as a human-readable string like `"1.0"` for 1 token, or as a `bigint` for precise control over decimals.
</Note>

<Warning>
Always validate the `payTo` address matches your wallet. The middleware does not check if the address is valid or belongs to you.
</Warning>
