description: Barrel package for all Armory middleware
title: "@armory-sh/middleware"
---

Convenience package that re-exports all framework-specific middleware.

## Installation

```bash
bun add @armory-sh/middleware
```

## What This Package Does

This is a **barrel package** — it simply re-exports everything from the framework-specific middleware packages. You can use it to import all middleware from a single package.

## Framework-Specific Packages

For detailed documentation, see:

| Package | Framework |
|---------|-----------|
| [`@armory-sh/middleware-bun`](/packages/middleware-bun) | Bun |
| [`@armory-sh/middleware-express`](/packages/middleware-express) | Express |
| [`@armory-sh/middleware-hono`](/packages/middleware-hono) | Hono |
| [`@armory-sh/middleware-elysia`](/packages/middleware-elysia) | Elysia |

## Quick Import

```typescript
// Import everything from one place
import {
  createBunMiddleware,
  paymentMiddleware,
  acceptPaymentsViaArmory,
} from '@armory-sh/middleware';
```

## Tips

<Note>
For production apps, consider importing directly from the framework-specific package. This reduces bundle size and makes dependencies clearer.
</Note>

<Tip>
Use this barrel package for quick prototyping or when building a multi-framework project.
