description: Payment middleware for Express
title: "@armory-sh/middleware-express"
---


Accept crypto payments in your Express API with a single middleware function.

## Installation

```bash
# npm
npm install @armory-sh/middleware-express

# yarn
yarn add @armory-sh/middleware-express

# pnpm
pnpm add @armory-sh/middleware-express

# bun
bun add @armory-sh/middleware-express
```

## Quick Start

This page covers Express v5+ with `@armory-sh/middleware-express`.

For Express v4, use the separate package page: [`@armory-sh/middleware-express-v4`](/packages/middleware-express-v4).

```typescript
import express from 'express';
import { paymentMiddleware } from '@armory-sh/middleware-express';

const app = express();

app.use(paymentMiddleware({
  requirements: {
    to: '0xYourWalletAddress...',
    amount: 1000000n, // 1 USDC (6 decimals)
    expiry: Date.now() + 3600 * 1000,
    chainId: 'eip155:8453',
    assetId: 'eip155:8453/erc20:0x833589fCD6eDb6E08f4c7C32D4f71B54bdA02913'
  }
}));

app.get('/api/protected', (req, res) => {
  // Payment info is attached to the request
  console.log(req.payment);
  res.json({ message: 'Payment verified!' });
});

app.listen(3000);
```

## How It Works

The middleware intercepts requests and:

1. Checks for payment headers (`X-Payment` or `X402-PAYMENT`)
2. Verifies the payment signature and amount
3. Attaches payment info to `req.payment`
4. Calls `next()` if valid, or returns 402 if invalid

---

## Configuration

### Payment Requirements

```typescript
{
  requirements: {
    to: string,           // Your wallet address
    amount: bigint,       // Amount in smallest unit (wei for native, token decimals for ERC20)
    expiry: number,       // Expiry timestamp (milliseconds)
    chainId: string,      // CAIP-2 chain ID (e.g., 'eip155:8453')
    assetId: string       // CAIP-19 asset ID
  }
}
```

### Common Token Addresses

| Network | Token | Address |
|---------|-------|---------|
| Base | USDC | `0x833589fCD6eDb6E08f4c7C32D4f71b54bdA02913` |
| Ethereum | USDC | `0xA0b86991c6218b36c1d19D4a2e9Eb0cE3606eB48` |
| Base | USDT | `0x50c5725949A6F0c72E6C4a641F24049A917DB0Cb` |

### Verification Options

See runtime verification configuration in your deployment environment and middleware setup.

## Accessing Payment Info

The middleware augments the Express request with payment information:

```typescript
app.get('/api/user', (req, res) => {
  const { payerAddress, payload, version, verified } = req.payment;

  res.json({
    welcome: `Hello ${payerAddress}`,
    youPaid: payload.amount,
    token: payload.token
  });
});
```

**Available Properties:**

| Property | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| `payload` | `PaymentPayload` | Decoded payment payload |
| `payerAddress` | `string` | Wallet address of the payer |
| `version` | `1 \| 2` | Payment protocol version |
| `verified` | `boolean` | Whether verification passed |

---

## Response Headers

On successful verification, the middleware adds:

```
X-Payment-Response: {"status":"verified","payerAddress":"0x...","version":2}
```

---

## Error Responses

### 402 Payment Required

No payment header was provided.

```json
{
  "error": "Payment required",
  "requirements": { ... }
}
```

### 400 Invalid Payload

Payment header exists but couldn't be decoded.

```json
{
  "error": "Invalid payment payload",
  "message": "..."
}
```

### 402 Verification Failed

Payment signature or amount was invalid.

```json
{
  "error": "Verification failed: ..."
}
```

## Tips

<Note>
Express middleware runs in order — place `paymentMiddleware` before any routes that require payment.
