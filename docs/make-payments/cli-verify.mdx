description: Inspect endpoint payment requirements and response headers
---

`armory verify` checks endpoint responses for payment headers and requirement metadata.

## Usage

```bash
armory verify https://api.example.com/premium
# alias
armory inspect https://api.example.com/premium
```

## Local Debug Workflow

```bash
# terminal 1
cd merchant-api
bun run dev

# terminal 2
armory verify http://localhost:3000/api/premium
```

## Example Output Interpretation

- `402` with `PAYMENT-REQUIRED`: endpoint is paywalled
- `200`: endpoint is open or payment already satisfied
- malformed/missing payment headers: check middleware wiring and route matching

## Troubleshooting

- Verify the route is protected in middleware config.
- Validate `chainId` and `assetId` used by your requirement payload.
- Confirm facilitator URL is reachable from your server runtime.
