# Quickstart for Facilitators

Run a facilitator to verify payments and settle them on-chain.

## Installation

```bash
bun add @armory/facilitator
```

## Basic Setup

```typescript
import { createFacilitatorServer } from '@armory/facilitator';

const server = createFacilitatorServer({
  port: 3000,
  walletClient,  // Your wallet for paying gas
  publicClient,  // Viem public client
});

await server.start();
```

## Configuration

```typescript
const server = createFacilitatorServer({
  port: 3000,
  walletClient,
  publicClient,
  acceptedNetworks: ['base', 'ethereum'],
  acceptedTokens: ['usdc', 'usdt'],
});
```

## How It Works

1. Receive payment verification requests from merchants
2. Verify the EIP-3009 signature
3. Check nonce hasn't been used
4. Settle payment on-chain via `transferWithAuthorization`
5. Return settlement confirmation

## Running a Production Facilitator

For production, you'll need:

- Nonce tracking (prevent replay attacks)
- Queue management (handle concurrent settlements)
- Rate limiting
- Monitoring and alerting

See [Deployment Guide](../../DEPLOYMENT.md) for full details.

## Next Steps
