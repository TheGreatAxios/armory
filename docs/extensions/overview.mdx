x402 extensions are protocol-level metadata attached to challenges and payment payloads via the `extensions` object.

Use extensions when a server requires additional fields beyond core payment data, such as authentication, idempotency, or discovery metadata.

## Built-in Extensions

- Sign-In-With-X (`siwx`) for wallet-authenticated access
- Payment Identifier (`paymentIdentifier`) for idempotency
- Bazaar (`bazaar`) for discovery metadata

## Extension Flow

1. Server declares required extensions in `PAYMENT-REQUIRED`
2. Client hooks inspect required extension metadata
3. Client adds extension payload fields before signing
4. Server verifies and processes extension data
